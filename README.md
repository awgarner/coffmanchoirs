# coffmanchoirs

This is my recreation of the website I created on Weebly for Dublin Coffman Choirs.

My goals are:

1. deploy this website and replace the Weebly version.

2. Make a responsive and mobile friendly design

3. Make the website DO something for class, calendar, assignments, solfege games, blog.. etc. 

4. Have Fun!
